                        Tap-Academy is the best e-learning platform .The concepts are taught very clearly and if we are faced with any doubts they make sure that ,they clear the doubts. Tap Academy teaches using augmented reality , which makes it is easier to grasp and understand the concepts clearly. Friendly environment and the mentors are easy to communicate.

                            like Html, Css and JavaScript. The augmented reality used by TapAcademy helped me a lot in a detailed manner from the memory point of view. So from my point of view if anyone asks me about the TapAcademy, I will definitely suggest for this course because
                             it's worthy. And it really helped me a lot. Thank you Mam, and thanks for the TapAcademy, because it helped me a lot and in future I will not only gain a job but I am confident that I will sustain in that job tooo Mam, and this is a basic pillar to me Mam.
