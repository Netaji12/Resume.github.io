                <dd>We have learnt about Relational Database
                    Management System (RDBMS) and purpose in the previous chapter. There are many RDBMS such
                    as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc. that allow us to create a database
                    consisting of relations and to link one or more relations for efficient querying to store, retrieve
                    and manipulate data on that database. In this chapter, we will learn how to create, populate and
                    query database using MySQL.</dd><hr>
                    <br>
                <dt>Structured Query Language (SQL)</dt>
                <dd>SQL is easy to learn as the statements comprise of
                    descriptive English words and are not case sensitive.
                    We can create and interact with a database using SQL
                    in an efficient and easy way. The benefit with SQL is
                    that we don’t have to specify how to get the data from
                    the database. Rather, we simply specify what is to be
                    retrieved, and SQL does the rest. Although called a query
                    language, SQL can do much more besides querying.
                    SQL provides statements for defining the structure of
                    the data, manipulating data in the database, declare
                    constraints and retrieve data from the database in
                    various ways, depending on our requirements.
                    In this chapter, we will learn how to create a database
                    using MySQL as the RDBMS software. We will create a
                    database called StudentAttendance that we
                    had identified in the previous chapter. We will also learn
                    how to populate database with data, manipulate data in
                    that and retrieve data from the database through SQL
                    queries.</dd><hr>

                <dt>Data Types and
                    Constraints in MySQL</dt>
                <dd>Data type indicates the type of data value that an
                    attribute can have. The data type of an attribute decides
                    the operations that can be performed on the data of
                    that attribute. For example, arithmetic operations can
                    be performed on numeric data but not on character
                    data. Commonly used data types in MySQL are numeric
                    types, date and time types, and string (character and
                    byte) types</dd>

                                255. CHAR is of fixed length, means, declaring CHAR (10) implies to reserve
                                spaces for 10 characters. If data does not have 10 characters (for example,
                                ‘city’ has four characters), MySQL fills the remaining 6 characters with spaces
                                padded on the right.</td>

                                to 65535. But unlike CHAR, VARCHAR is a variable-length data type. That is,
                                declaring VARCHAR (30) means a maximum of 30 characters can be stored
                                but the actual allocated bytes will depend on the length of entered string. So
                                ‘city’ in VARCHAR (30) will occupy the space needed to store 4 characters only</td>

                    is not mandatory to define constraint for each attribute

                <dt>SQL for Data Definition</dt>
                <dd>SQL provides commands for defining the relation
                    schemas, modifying relation schemas and deleting
                    relations. These are called Data Definition Language
                    (DDL) through which the set of relations are specified,
                    including their schema, data type for each attribute, the
                    constraints as well as the security and access related
                    authorisations.
                    Data definition starts with the create statement. This
                    statement is used to create a database and its tables
                    (relations). Before creating a database, we should be
                    clear about the number of tables in the database, the
                    columns (attributes) in each table along with the data
                    type of each column. This is how we decide the relation
                    schema.</dd><br>

                <dt>SQL for Data
                    Manipulation</dt>
                <dd>In the previous section, we created the database
                    StudentAttendance having three relations STUDENT,
                    GUARDIAN and ATTENDANCE. When we create a table,
                    only its structure is created but the table has no data.
                    To populate records in the table, INSERT statement is
                    used. Similarly, table records can be deleted or updated
                    using SQL data manipulation statements.
                    Data Manipulation using a database means either
                    retrieval (access) of existing data, insertion of new data,
                    removal of existing data or modification of existing data
                    in the database.

                <dt>SQL for Data Query</dt>
                <dd>So far we have learnt how to create database as well
                    as to store and manipulate data. We are interested to
                    store data in a database as it is easier to retrieve data
                    in future from databases in whatever way we want.
                    The Structured Query Language (SQL) has efficient
                    mechanisms to retrieve data stored in multiple tables
                    in a MySQL database (or any other RDBMS). The
                    user enters the SQL commands called queries where
                    the specific requirements for data to be retrieved are
                    provided. The SQL statement SELECT is used to retrieve
                    data from the tables in a database and is also called
                    query statement.</dd>

                <dd>Updation and deletion of data are also the parts of SQL
                    data manipulation. In this section, we are going to apply
                    these two data manipulation methods.</dd>
                    <dt>Data Updation</dt>
                    <dd>We may need to make changes in the value(s) of one or
                        more columns of existing records in a table. For example,
                        we may require some changes in address, phone number
                        or spelling of name, etc. The UPDATE statement is used to
                        make such modifications in the existing data.
                        Syntax:
                        UPDATE table_name
                        SET attribute1 = value1, attribute2 = value2, ...</dd>
                    <dt>Data Deletion</dt>
                    <dd>The DELETE statement is used to delete one or more
                        record(s) from a table.
                        Syntax:
